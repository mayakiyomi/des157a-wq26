				<h1>CONTACT</h1>
				<p>Here's an old contact sheet–a composite of every image I took on a roll of film. Scroll to explore the different frames!</p>

				<h1>Light</h1>
				<p>Shooting in black and white makes me focus more intensly on light. I can't rely on color to make an image interesting, so light and shadow become major players. I like images with a lot of contrast, and focusing on how light paints its way into the image.</p>

				<h1>The Mundane</h1>
				<p>Using such an analog method makes even the smallest moments feel more precious. You only have so many attempts to capture it well.</p>
                <p>Look how the gap in the trees allow the lamppost to enter the scene.

				<h1>Curiosity</h1>
				<p>This treehouse sits on a corner on the border between Berkeley and Oakland. Whenever we walk back from the BART after a night out, or from Telegraph getting coffee, we always joke about climbing up and seeing what it's like up there. </p> <p>Maybe one day.</p>

				<h1>A Portal</h1>
				<p>On a post-coffee walk around the Berkeley hills, we stumbled upon this gate leading to a neightborhood of vine-covered brick houses and hedge-lined front lawns. Like a portal from the busy streets to quiet paradise.</p>

				<h1>Goodnight</h1>
				<p>The neon haze captures so well on film. This day was fun–chaotic, full of music and chaos and excitement, but when we left the venue after the show, it was so peaceful out. I took this photo to remember it, and even though you can't see the neon red lights or the navy sky, you still get the feeling.</p>
