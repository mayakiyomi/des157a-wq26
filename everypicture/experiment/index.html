				<h1>Light</h1>
				<p>Shooting in black and white makes me focus more intensly on light. I can't rely on color to make an image interesting, so light and shadow become major players. I like images with a lot of contrast, and focusing on how light paints its way into the image.</p>

				<h1>Framing</h1>
				<p>I like finding scenes that are visually interesting and have elements that "speak" to each other, even if there are no living subjects present. Look how the gap in the trees allow the lamppost to enter the scene.

				<h1>Subject</h1>
				<p>Portraiture looks great in black and white, but I like to lean into the mysterious connotations of the medium and capture places without subjects. I think that it creates more narrative freedom and makes the images more interesting, because the viewers get to decide what's happening in the photo for themselves. </p>
